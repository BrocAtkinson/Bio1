  <div class="container_about">
    <p1>I am currently a full time certified paralegal,
       hoping this course will help me break into the web development field. 
       Spending the last 10 years as a paralegal I have decided it was time to follow a carreer change I have been contempalting for sometime. 
       Perosnally I enjoy being active inside or out,
        along with giving back as a high school basketball coach and volunteer team member for a garage who helps single mothers keep their vehicles running and problem free. </p>

    <p2>The link below is from my bootcamps 1st group project, 
      where I handeled the API call for the New York Times and the quick seach buttons that populate the top 5 coins. 
      When we divided up the teams responsiblyt javascript was the most intimidating part to me to I decided thats where I wanted to be as a few teams members were very strong in this area. 
       I started the bootcamp with limited knowledge of being a developer, 
       but really enjoy the fact its a field of continuous learning. I have always had a team player mentality helping anyone and anywhere that is needed to achieve the end goal 
       and alway welcoming feedback to help with my growth. </p>
